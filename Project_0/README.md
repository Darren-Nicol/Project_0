Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi Team CS50,

I decided to create a website showing a family hobby, classic cars. I built the basic five page site using the following steps: -

1.) Created a webpages file with an HTML file for each webpage;
2.) Create head tags with title and links to bootstrap;
3.) Created 5 pages home, about-us, services, classic-cars and contact-us;
4.) Connected the 5 pages using buttons/ hyper-links;
5.) Add table to classic-cars.html page;
6.) Add list to classic-cars.html page;
7.) Add pricing option table with nested lists (Bootstrap component) to services.html page;
8.) Add gallery images to grid (Bootstrap component) in about-us.html page;
9.) Create styles.css file including properties and selectors (4 elements, 1 id and 8 .class), also included @media query that only prints certain content (table not the conditions) on the classic-cars.html page and a @media query that changes background color at a certain size;
10.) Add responsive background image to home.html page;
11.) Add footer to all pages;
12.) Add nav-bar for buttons to all pages;
13.) Add contact-us page with form (note- it isn't connected to notifications or database- likely future lesson!);
14.) Add transparent Jumbotron (Bootstrap component) on homepage;
15.) Add check our rental stock button to link home.html to classic-car.html page;
16.) Created a sass file called sass_style.scss, and created a variable called color, applied it to the tag h3 which is used in the footer. I then converted it to a CSS file and added links to each page to the sass_style.css file;
17.) Created a sass file called sass_nesting.scss, created a div with nested paragraph and unordered list. Converted it to a CSS file, added link to and used it in the services.html file.
18.) Created a sass file called sass_inheritance.scss including the parent message and child classes success, thanks and bye. I then converted to sass_inheritance.css to use on an HTML file. I created a feedback.html file and created three messages for feedback once they have completed a contact us form.  

My key learning is to spend some time at the start to plan as I spent more time than I should have adding the same element to each of the pages. I should have set up a repeatable template page and reused. For example, I spent some time adding step 11 (nav-bar) to each page when it could have been included in the original that I could then copy. I should have also set up the css and sass files from the get-go, this would have added more control as I have ended up with external, internal and inline CSS and limited use of the inheritance, nesting and variables SASS functions.  

All good practice.

Thanks for reviewing and look forward to any comments.

Best, Darren.      



Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
